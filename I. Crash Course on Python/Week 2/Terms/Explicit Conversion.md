**[[Explicit Conversion]]** is where we manually convert from one data type to another by calling the relevant function for the data type we want to convert to. We used this in our video example when we wanted to print a number alongside some text. Before we could do that, we needed to call the _str()_ function to convert the number into a string. Once the number was explicitly converted to a string, we could join it with the rest of our textual string and print the result.

**[[explicit conversion]]** - when code is written to manually convert one data type to another using a data type conversion function:
    - **[[str()]]** - converts a value (often numeric) to a **string** data type
    - **[[int()]]** - converts a value (usually a float) to an **integer** data type
    - **[[float()]]** - converts a value (usually an integer) to a **float** data type
