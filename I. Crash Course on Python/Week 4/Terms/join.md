We took a look at string concatenation using the plus sign, earlier. We can also use the **[[join]]** method to concatenate strings. This method is called on a string that will be used to join a list of strings. The method takes a list of strings to be joined as a parameter, and returns a new string composed of each of the strings from our list joined using the initial string. For example, **" ".join(["This","is","a","sentence"])** would return the string **"This is a sentence"**.
