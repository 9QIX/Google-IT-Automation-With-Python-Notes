The string method **[[lower]]** will return the string with all characters changed to lowercase. The inverse of this is the **[[upper]]** method, which will return the string all in uppercase. Just like with previous methods, we call these on a string using dot notation, like **"this is a string".upper()**. This would return the string **"THIS IS A STRING"**. This can be super handy when checking user input, since someone might type in all lowercase, all uppercase, or even a mixture of cases.
