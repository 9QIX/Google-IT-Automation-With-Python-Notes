A [[Function]] is a piece of code that performs a unit of work. In the examples you've seen so far, you have only encountered the **print()** function, which outputs a message to the screen. You will use this function frequently in this course to check the results of your code. The syntax of the print() function is modeled in the example below.

```python
# Syntax for printing a string of text. Click Run to check the result.
print("Hello world!")
```
