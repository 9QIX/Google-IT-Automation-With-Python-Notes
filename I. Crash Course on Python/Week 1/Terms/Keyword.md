# Keywords

A [[Keyword]] is a reserved word in a programming language that performs a specific purpose. In your first Python example, you briefly encountered the keywords **for** and **in**. Note that keywords will often appear in **bold** in this course.Â 

In the next few weeks, you will also learn the following keywords:

- Values: **True**, **False**, **None** 
- Conditions: **if**, **elif**, **else** 
- Logical operators: **and**, **or**, **not** 
- Loops: **for**, **in**, **while**, **break**, **continue** 
- Functions: **def**, **return**
