## **Artificial Intelligence**

It is important to understand that basic automation is not the same as [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]]. 

[[Automation]] is used to explicitly instruct a machine on how to perform a task. 

[[Artificial intelligence (AI)]] involves training a computing machine to perform more complex tasks through a process called [[Machine Learning]]. This process prepares the AI software to perform new tasks without a human needing to program explicit instructions for each task. Although AI is often used for automating human tasks, AI automation is much more complex than basic automation.
