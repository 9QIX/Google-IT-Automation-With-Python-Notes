## More About Python

### Using Python on your own

The best way to learn any programming language is to practice it on your own as much as you can. If you have Python installed on your computer, you can execute the interpreter by running the python3 command (or just python on Windows), and you can close it by typing exit() or Ctrl-D.

If you don’t already have Python installed on your machine, that’s alright. We’ll explain how to install it in an upcoming course.

### Python practice resources

In the meantime, you can still practice by using one of the many online Python interpreters or codepads available online. There’s not much difference between an interpreter and a codepad. An interpreter is more interactive than a codepad, but they both let you execute code and see the results.

Below, you’ll find links to some of the most popular online interpreters and codepads. Give them a go to find your favorite.

### Additional Python resources

While this course will give you information about how Python works and how to write scripts in Python, you’ll likely want to find out more about specific parts of the language. Here are some great ways to help you find additional info: 

- Read the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- Search for answers or ask a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- Subscribe to the Python [tutor](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor)mailing list, where you can ask questions and collaborate with other Python learners.
- Subscribe to the [Python-announce](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-announce-list)mailing list to read about the latest updates in the language.

### Python history and current status

Python was released almost 30 years ago and has a rich history. You can read more about it on the [History of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python) Wikipedia page or in the section on the [history of the software](https://docs.python.org/3.0/license.html) from the official Python documentation.

Python has recently been called the fastest growing programming language. If you're interested in why this is and how it’s measured, you can find out more in these articles:

# A Note on Syntax and Code Blocks

When writing code, using correct syntax is critical. Even a small typo, like a missing parenthesis bracket or an extra comma, can cause a syntax error and the code won't execute at all. If your code results in an error or an exception, pay close attention to syntax and watch out for minor mistakes. A single wrong character could take hours to identify in long code so it is important to be mindful of syntax when writing code. 

## **Common syntax errors:**

- Misspellings
- Incorrect indentations
- Missing or incorrect key characters:
    - Bracket types - ( curved ), [ square ], { curly }
    - Quote types - "straight-double" or 'straight-single', “curly-double” or ‘curly-single’
    - Block introduction characters, like colons - :
- Data type mismatches
- Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words
- Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language 

If your syntax is correct, but the script has unexpected behavior or output, this may be due to a semantic problem. 

[[Syntax]] is like the vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and punctuation of code. 

[[Semantics]] are the meaning and logic of coded statements. It is possible to have syntactically correct code that runs successfully, but doesn't do what we want it to do.

## **Common semantic errors:**

- Creating functional code, but getting unintentional output
- Poor logic structures in the design of the code

When working with the code blocks in exercises for this course, be mindful of syntax and semantic (logic) errors, along with the overall result of your code. Just because you fixed an error doesn't mean that the code will have the desired effect when it runs! Once you’ve fixed an error in your code, don't forget to click Run to check your work.

# Study Guide: Introduction to Python

This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz.  

In this segment, you learned that [[Python]] is a general purpose programming language that is commonly used for scripting and automation, as well as to develop a wide variety of applications. Python is compatible with most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, and is updated every few years. Python can also run on a variety of machines, such as servers, workstations, PCs, mobile devices, IoT, and more.

[[Python]] is widely used in the IT field, including IT support, system administration, web development, machine learning, data analytics, and more. Python can be used to calculate statistics, run your e-commerce site, process images, interact with web services, and do a whole host of other tasks. Python instructions resemble the English language, which is what makes it easier to learn and understand when compared to other programming languages.

**Python is:**

- a general purpose scripting language;
- a popular language used to code a variety of applications;
- a frequently used tool for automation;
- a cross-platform compatible language;
- a beginner-friendly language.

**Python is not:** 

- a platform-specific / OS-specific scripting language;
- a client-side scripting language;
- a purely object-oriented programming language.

## Code comparison with Python

You will be learning about both Python and Bash scripting in this program. The following code illustrates a syntax difference between the two languages:

|**Print to screen in Python**|**Print to screen in Bash**|
|---|---|
|>> print("Hello, how are you?")<br><br>Hello, how are you?|>> echo Hello, how are you?<br><br>Hello, how are you?|

# Key Terms

- **[[Platform-specific or OS specific scripting language]]** - Platform-specific scripting languages, like PowerShell (for Windows) and Bash (for Linux), are used by system administrators on those platforms. 
- **[[Client-side scripting language]]** - Client-side scripting languages, like JavaScript, are used mostly for web programming. The scripts are transferred from a web server to the end-user’s internet browser, then executed in the browser.
- **[[Machine language]]** - Machine language is the lowest-level computer language. It communicates directly with computing machines in binary code (ones and zeros). 
	- In binary code, one equals a pulse of electricity and zero equals no electrical pulse. Machine language instructions are made from translating languages like Python into complex patterns of ones and zeros. 
- **[[Cross-platform language]]** - Programming language that is compatible with one or more platforms / operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android).
- **[[Object-oriented programming language]]** - In object-oriented programming languages, most coding elements are considered to be objects with configurable properties. For example, a form field is an object that can be configured to accept only dates as input in the mm/dd/yy format, and can be configured to read from and write to a specific database. 
- **[[Python interpreter]] -** An interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code by translating Python code into computer instructions.

# Study Guide: First Programming Concepts

This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz. 

# Functions 

A [[Function]] is a piece of code that performs a unit of work. In the examples you've seen so far, you have only encountered the **print()** function, which outputs a message to the screen. You will use this function frequently in this course to check the results of your code. The syntax of the print() function is modeled in the example below.

```python
# Syntax for printing a string of text. Click Run to check the result.
print("Hello world!")
```

# Keywords

A [[Keyword]] is a reserved word in a programming language that performs a specific purpose. In your first Python example, you briefly encountered the keywords **for** and **in**. Note that keywords will often appear in **bold** in this course. 

In the next few weeks, you will also learn the following keywords:

- Values: **True**, **False**, **None** 
- Conditions: **if**, **elif**, **else** 
- Logical operators: **and**, **or**, **not** 
- Loops: **for**, **in**, **while**, **break**, **continue** 
- Functions: **def**, **return**

You don't need to learn this whole list now. We'll dive into each keyword as we encounter them. There are additional reserved keywords in Python. If you would like to read about them, please visit the linked “Python Keywords” article in the Resources section at the end of this study guide. 

# Arithmetic operators

Python can calculate numbers using common mathematical operators, along with some special operators, too:  

```
x + y       Addition + operator returns the sum of x plus y

x - y       Subtraction - operator returns the difference of x minus y

x * y       Multiplication * operator returns the product of x times y

x / y       Division / operator returns the quotient of x divided by y

x**e       Exponent ** operator returns the result of raising x to the power of e 

x**2       Square expression returns x squared

x**3       Cube expression returns x cubed

x**(1/2)   Square root (½) or (0.5) fractional exponent operator returns the square root of x

x // y           Floor division operator returns the integer part of the integer division of x by y

x % y          Modulo operator returns the remainder part of the integer division of x by y
```

## Order of operations

The order of operations are to be calculated from left to right in the following order: 

```
1. Parentheses ( ), { }, [ ]
2. Exponents xe   (x**e)
3. Multiplication * and Division /  
4. Addition + and Subtraction -  
```

You might find the **PEMDAS** mnemonic device to be helpful in remembering the order.
