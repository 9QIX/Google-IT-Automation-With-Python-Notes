# Uses for Automation

[[Scripts]] can be used for automating specific tasks. 

[[Automation]] is used to replace a repetitive manual step with one that happens automatically. 

Humans are fallible. They can become tired, make mistakes, fail to follow instructions, be inconsistent in their job performance, and more. In contrast, automated processes complete instructions exactly as coded, in a consistent manner. They can run 24 hours a day, everyday, without tiring. For many tasks that are appropriate for automation, it can be more cost effective to use automation than human labor. 

## **Appropriate uses for automation include:**

- The automatic timing and regulation of traffic lights
- A repetitive task that is at high risk for human error
- Sending commands to a computer
- Detecting and removing duplicates of data
- Sending automated emails that are personalized by pulling individual names from a database and plugging them into the email 
- Updating a large number of file permissions
- Reporting on system data, like disk or memory usage
- Installing software
- Generating reports
- Deploying a file or a computer program to all computers on a company network
- Using a configuration management system to deploy software patches, after a human has _designed_ the system
- Populating an e-commerce site with products
- Setting the home directory and access permissions for users

## **Automation is not always an appropriate or complete solution**

[[Automation]] cannot perform all human work. Tasks that call for human creativity, social connection, psychology, flexibility, ingenuity, evaluation, and/or complex analytic work are not good candidates for full automation. 

Sometimes automation can be used to perform one or more subtasks of a larger set of tasks – but – human intervention is required to complete the tasks. The following are some examples of tasks that cannot or should not be **fully** automated:

- Items that require human evaluation and analytic skills:
    - _Designing_ a configuration management system
    - Investigating and troubleshooting all end user problems
    - Writing a computer program
    - Building a new startup business
- Items that require human creativity and/or an eye for aesthetic qualities:
    - Designing an attractive webpage _(AI can do this, but simple automation cannot)_ 
    - Wedding photography
    - Haircuts and styling
- Items that cannot be automated due to basic physics:
    - Troubleshooting or repairing machines that cannot power on or boot up 
- Items that need human interaction, psychology, and/or evaluation skills:
    - Interviewing and hiring new employees
    - Customer service _(chat bots cannot address every customer service need)_
- Items that should not be fully automated due to costs and safety:
    - Grocery store checkout process, including bagging groceries
    - Tasks that are less expensive to perform manually

## **Artificial Intelligence**

It is important to understand that basic automation is not the same as [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)]]. 

[[Automation]] is used to explicitly instruct a machine on how to perform a task. 

[[Artificial intelligence (AI)]] involves training a computing machine to perform more complex tasks through a process called [[Machine Learning]]. This process prepares the AI software to perform new tasks without a human needing to program explicit instructions for each task. Although AI is often used for automating human tasks, AI automation is much more complex than basic automation.

# Key Terms

- **[[Programming Code]]** - Programming code is a set of written computer instructions, guided by rules, using a computer programming language. It might help to think of the computer instructions as a detailed, step-by-step recipe for performing tasks. The instructions tell computers and machines how to perform an action. Programming code may also be referred to as source code or scripts.
- **[[Programming Languages]]** - Programming languages are similar to human spoken languages in that they both use syntax and semantics. Programming languages are used to write computer programs.  Some common programming languages include Python, Java, C, C++, C#, and R.
- **[[Syntax]]** - Syntax is a set of rules for how statements are constructed in both human and computer languages. Programming syntax includes rules for the order of elements in programming instructions, as well as the use of special characters and their placements in statements. This concept is similar to the syntax rules for grammar and punctuation in human language.
- **[[Semantics]]** - Semantics refers to the intended meaning or effect of statements, or collections of words, in both human and computer languages. Semantic errors are also referred to as logical errors.
- **[[Computer Program]]** - A computer program is a step-by-step list of instructions that a computer follows to reach an intended goal. It is important to be clear and precise about the actions a computer program is supposed to perform because computers will do exactly what they are instructed to do. Computer programs can be long, complex, and accomplish a variety of tasks. They are often developed by computer programmers and software engineers, but anyone can learn to create them. Computer programs may involve a structured development cycle. They can be written in a wide variety of programming languages, such as **Python, Java, C++,  R**, and more. The completed format of a program is often a single executable file.
- **[[Script]]** - Scripts are usually shorter and less complex than computer programs. Scripts are often used to automate specific tasks. However, they can be used for complex tasks if needed. Scripts are often written by IT professionals, but anyone can learn to write scripts. Scripts have a shorter, less structured development cycle as compared to the development of complex computer programs and software. Scripts can be written in a variety of programming languages, like **Python, Javascript, Ruby, Bash**, and more. Some scripting languages are interpreted languages and are only compatible with certain platforms.
- **[[Automation]]** - Automation is used to replace a repetitive manual step with one that happens automatically. 
- **[[Output]]** - Output is the end result of a task performed by a function or computer program. Output can include a single value, a report, entries into a database, and more. 
- **[[Input]]** - Input is information that is provided to a program by the end user. Input can be text, voice, images, biometrics, and more.   
- **[[Functions]]** - A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
- **[[Variables]]** - Variables are used to temporarily store changeable values in programming code.
