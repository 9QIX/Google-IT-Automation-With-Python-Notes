The **[[range()]]** function uses a set of indices that point to integer values, which start at the number 0. The numeric values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 correlate to ordinal index positions 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th. So, when a range call to the 5th index position is made using **range(5)** the index is pointing to the numeric value of 4.

|Index Number|1st index|2nd index|3rd index|4th index|5th index|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Value|0|1|2|3|4|

The **[[range()]]** function can take up to three parameters:  **range(start, stop, step)**
