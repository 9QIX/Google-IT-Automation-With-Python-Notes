- **[[Unintended infinite loops]].** Make sure that the body of the loop modifies the variables used in the condition, so that the loop will eventually end for all possible values of the variables. You can often prevent an infinite loop by using the **break** keyword or by adding end criteria to the condition part of the **while** loop.
